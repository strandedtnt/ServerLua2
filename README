To Install you must have the lua .dll or .so from the lua website in your server and you must have a mod that supports lua

Once you have that, Put Zellymod.lua in your etmain directory.

Couple things:

Might not work for different mods

Lots of stuff is commented out due to the fact it dosent work or I dont want it on the server at the moment. Most of it works however.

Its messy I know :)

I try to keep it clean but I work on it so much and its a compilation of many different Luas that have been personally edited
