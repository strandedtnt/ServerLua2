To Install you must have the lua .dll or .so from the lua website in your server and you must have a mod that supports lua

Once you have that, Put Zellymod.lua in your etmain directory.

Couple things:

Might not fully work on other mods

Working on cleaning it up, so not all features are included at the moment.

Right now it mainly just has some custom commands, and killing spree tracking.

I need to learn a bit more on how file writing works for et.
(I get error Filehandler, There are many ways I have tried)
(My next shot will be just to write everything into a variable,
and then go on to writing at the end of the round)
